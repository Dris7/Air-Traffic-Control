# Air-Traffic-Control Simulation Web Application

This web application is a real-time simulation of air traffic control using Java on the server side with the help of multithreading technology. It includes several tasks and algorithms such as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, building an API to get data from the server to the client as JSON, auto-weather handling, and a cool and simple design using the Canvas API.
Experience the thrill of air traffic control in a real-time simulation with our cutting-edge web application. Developed using Java on the server side, our application leverages the power of multithreading technology to deliver a seamless and immersive experience.

2. Ensure that Java is installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the command `java -jar air-traffic-control.jar` to start the server.
5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/Air-Traffic-Control/homePage.jsp` to access the web application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can immerse yourself in the world of air traffic control and manage the movement of aircraft in real-time. The application includes several cutting-edge features, including:

- Graphical display of the airport, runways, and aircraft
- Auto-weather handling, which affects the behavior of the aircraft
- Shortest path algorithm for finding the most efficient routes for aircraft
- API for retrieving data from the server in JSON format
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Advanced auto-weather handling that dynamically affects the behavior of the aircraft
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for optimizing aircraft movement
- Robust API for efficient and secure data transfer in JSON format
- User-friendly graphical user interface designed using the Canvas API
